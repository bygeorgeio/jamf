# Jamf Scripts and Automations

A curated collection of scripts, automations, and deployment best practices for Jamf Pro environments.  
Each subfolder contains a project with detailed instructions, source code, and sample usage for easy implementation.

**Why?**  
Jamf Pro is powerful, but scripting is where true magic happens. This repo gathers real-world solutions that I‚Äôve used, refined, and continuously improved in my day-to-day work. If you‚Äôre a Mac admin or automation enthusiast, you‚Äôll find practical, production-ready tools here.

## üìÅ Initiatives
