# Jamf Scripts & Automations

A growing collection of battle-tested scripts and deployment examples for Jamf Pro, covering common, complex, and quirky macOS management tasks.

Each subfolder is a real-world initiative, complete with step-by-step instructions, sample code, and “works in production” tips. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

## Initiatives

- [network-pac-watcher](./network-pac-watcher): Automagic PAC file and Wi-Fi management for macOS, featuring Abracadabra Industries as our whimsical demo company.
- [set-computername-serial](./set-computername-serial): Instantly sets a Mac’s computer name to its serial number and updates the Jamf server—handy for enforcing naming standards at deployment or en masse.
- [forget-wifi](./forget-wifi): Allows standard users to forget Wi-Fi networks and edit network prefs without admin prompts by tweaking authorizationdb and airport settings.
- [proxymon](./proxymon): Simple proxy monitor for macOS that toggles a PAC file on or off depending on the reachability of your corporate host; includes a LaunchDaemon for continuous monitoring.

(More folders coming soon!)
